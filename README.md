# Capstone-Project
Project Overview
- The Goal of this project is to predict which type of crimes will occur during the day based on historical data features such as Location, Weather, Time, etc
- This affect reaches to all people living in the Los Angeles area and the surrounding neighborhoods. It focuses on all types of crimes including property crimes, violent crimes, crimes against property, battery, etc
- My solution is to do an in depth EDA to find out which aspects have the largest impact on a particular crime occurring and how that impacts people on a daily basis, find the most impacted neighborhoods using different visualization tools such as a heatmap, and finally developing a model that will accurately predict the type of crime to occur in an area
